# SCHT_OPT
## Description
This code is used to solve the topology optimization problem of simplified convective heat transfer.
## Configuration environment
(1) **OpenFOAM-6** (new version is applicable)  
(2) **PETSc-3.12.0** (new version is applicable)  
(3) **openMPI-1.10.0** (new version is not applicable)  
Parallel version of **MMA** changed by Yu Minghao  is also needed for updating the design variables (https://github.com/MTopOpt/MTO).
